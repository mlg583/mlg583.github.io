		<h2>As We May Think</h2>
		<p>Vannevar Bush's As We May Think is a very interesting look at a historical prediction of the future. A lot of the general ideas proposed have come to actually exist in a similar way described. A phone or computer accomplishes all and more of the "Memex" he describes. Bush describes the necessecity of accurately managing storing information in a world that has the technology he envisions, and describes solutions that are used now such as keyword searches when the technology simply did not exist at the time.</p>

	<h2>Long Live the Web</h2>
		<p>This is a piece written by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, about the state of the internet and keeping it open and Democratic. He discusses censorship and the influence of coorporations and governents on the web, centralizing power and control. He believes the the internet should be controlled by the people, more as a decentralized utility, and advocates for net neutrality. I think the points he makes are more relevant now than when he wrote them. In very recent times we have seen governents and Big Tech take extreme measures and use their power to assert control over the internet. Currently, Facebook is forcing their will on the Australian governent, which in my personal opinion is an obscene abuse of power and demands regulation.</p>
