            <p class="paragraph">One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age is a collaborative project by artists Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied. The project serves to preserve and restore websites from the historic GeoCities. GeoCities was a platform that offered users the ability to host their own websites with freedom of design. The data from GeoCities was nearly lost in 2009, however nearly a terabyte of GeoCities pages was rescued by a volunteer team. One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age is a Tumblr page consisting of screenshots of GeoCities pages that were salvaged from and modified from the ruins of GeoCities. Screenshots from GeoCities are consistenly uploaded at a rate of one every 20 minutes. Espenshchied and Lialina update their research of GeoCities trends and vernacular on their blog which you can access here: <a class ="link" href="https://blog.geocities.institute/">GeoCities Research Institute blog.</a><br><br>
            At first glance, One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age seemed very outdated and hectic. However, after scrolling through the numerous screenshots of old GeoCities pages, we began to appreciate the time in which we live in. The site contained many "I have a website," "Cute Boy/Fanpage Site," and "American's idea of Japanese Culture," all which were amusing to observe. After some time, the content became repetitive and many of the screenshots we viewed started to become mundane - however given the time these sites were created, it seemed expected. It was a very interesting and nostalgic experience looking over these historic web pages and we could see the amount of care Lialina and Espenschied put into these artifacts in terms of technical restoriation and contextual research. <br>
